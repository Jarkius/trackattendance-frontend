# Cloud API Configuration
CLOUD_API_URL=https://trackattendance-api-969370105809.asia-southeast1.run.app
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32 (must match API_KEY on the server)
CLOUD_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# ============================================================================
# AUTO SYNC SETTINGS (Local check - NO API cost)
# ============================================================================
# These settings control when the app checks locally if pending scans need syncing.
# The check itself does NOT call the API - only actual sync uploads do.

# Maximum scans to upload per sync batch (prevents timeout on large uploads)
# Range: 50-500, Higher = faster sync but longer request time
CLOUD_SYNC_BATCH_SIZE=100

# Enable/disable automatic background sync
AUTO_SYNC_ENABLED=True

# Seconds of idle time (no scanning) before auto-sync triggers
# Prevents sync during active scanning sessions
# Range: 10-120, Lower = more responsive, Higher = less interruption
AUTO_SYNC_IDLE_SECONDS=30

# How often (seconds) to check if sync is needed (LOCAL check, no API call)
# This only checks: "Are there pending scans AND has idle time passed?"
# Range: 30-300, Does NOT affect API cost
AUTO_SYNC_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60

# Minimum pending scans required before auto-sync triggers
# Set higher to batch more scans before uploading
# Range: 1-50, 1 = sync immediately when idle, Higher = batch more
AUTO_SYNC_MIN_PENDING_SCANS=1

# How long (ms) to show sync status message in UI
AUTO_SYNC_MESSAGE_DURATION_MS=3000

# Timeout (seconds) for sync HTTP requests
AUTO_SYNC_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=5

# ============================================================================
# CONNECTION HEALTH CHECK (API cost - adjust for multi-machine deployments)
# ============================================================================
# These settings poll the API to check if connection is alive.
# IMPORTANT: Each check = 1 API call. Multiply by number of machines!
#
# Example: 10 machines at event
#   - 60s interval = 10 calls/min = 600 calls/hr (recommended)
#   - 20s interval = 30 calls/min = 1,800 calls/hr (expensive)
#   - 120s interval = 5 calls/min = 300 calls/hr (economical)
#
# For large events (10+ machines): Use 60-120 seconds
# For single machine: 20-60 seconds is fine

# Connection check interval (seconds). Set to 0 to disable polling entirely.
# Recommended: 60s for events, 20-30s for development/testing
CONNECTION_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60

# Timeout for each health check request
CONNECTION_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5

# Delay before first connection check after app startup
# Allows app to fully load before checking connection
CONNECTION_CHECK_INITIAL_DELAY_SECONDS=15

# Hysteresis: Requires 2 consecutive failures before showing offline indicator
# This prevents flicker from transient network issues

# ============================================================================
# UI Settings
# ============================================================================
SHOW_FULL_SCREEN=True
ENABLE_FADE_ANIMATION=True

# Party/Event background image (disco balls) - v1.4.0+
# Set to True for festive events, False for plain grey background

# Duplicate Badge Detection (Issue #20, #21)
# Prevent users from scanning the same badge multiple times in quick succession
DUPLICATE_BADGE_DETECTION_ENABLED=True
DUPLICATE_BADGE_TIME_WINDOW_SECONDS=300
# Action: 'warn' (accept + alert), 'block' (reject), 'silent' (accept + no alert)
DUPLICATE_BADGE_ACTION=block
# Alert duration in milliseconds (2000ms = 2 seconds, default duration)
# Includes fade-in/out animation (300ms) and bounce scale effect
DUPLICATE_BADGE_ALERT_DURATION_MS=2000

# Duration (ms) to show employee name and "THANK YOU" after scan
# before returning to "Ready to scan..." state
# Range: 1000-5000, Higher = longer display, Lower = faster reset
SCAN_FEEDBACK_DURATION_MS=2000

# ============================================================================
# Voice Playback
# ============================================================================
# Play a random voice clip from assets/voices/ on successful badge scan
VOICE_ENABLED=True
# Playback volume (0.0 = muted, 1.0 = full volume)
VOICE_VOLUME=1.0

# ============================================================================
# Camera Proximity Detection (Optional Plugin)
# ============================================================================
# When enabled, the camera detects people approaching the kiosk and plays
# a voice greeting prompting them to scan their badge.
# Camera does NOT scan barcodes — badge scanning remains USB-only.
# Requires: opencv-python-headless, numpy (mediapipe optional for better detection)
ENABLE_CAMERA_DETECTION=False

# -- Hardware --
# Camera device index (0 = built-in laptop camera, 1+ = external)
# CAMERA_DEVICE_ID=0
# Camera capture resolution (Haar cascade needs at least 320x240 for reliable face detection)
# Higher = better detection but more CPU. 320x240 is recommended for proximity-only use.
# CAMERA_RESOLUTION_WIDTH=320
# CAMERA_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT=240
# Camera overlay: True = live camera preview (debug), False = small status icon only (production)
# CAMERA_SHOW_OVERLAY=True

# -- Greeting behavior --
# Minimum seconds between greetings — if someone leaves and returns within
# this window, the greeting is suppressed (prevents "revolving door" repeats)
# CAMERA_GREETING_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=60
# Seconds to suppress greetings after a badge scan (quiet during busy queues)
# CAMERA_SCAN_BUSY_SECONDS=30

# -- Detection tuning --
# Minimum detection size as fraction of frame width — filters out distant people
# 0.15 = face must fill at least 15% of frame (~0.5-1m from camera)
# Lower = detect further away, higher = only very close. Range: 0.05-0.80
# CAMERA_MIN_SIZE_PCT=0.15
# Seconds with no person visible before kiosk resets to "empty" (ready to greet next person)
# CAMERA_ABSENCE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS=3
# Consecutive detected frames required before greeting (prevents false positives from shadows/flickers)
# At ~15 FPS with frame skipping, 2 confirmations ≈ 0.4s of confirmed presence
# CAMERA_CONFIRM_FRAMES=2

# Debug/Logging (optional)
# DEBUG=True disables auto-focus to allow copying debug console output
DEBUG=False
# LOGGING_LEVEL: Sets Python logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
# Must use LOGGING_LEVEL (not LOG_LEVEL) to match config.py variable name
LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO

# PIN for admin features (4-6 digits). Leave empty to disable admin features.
