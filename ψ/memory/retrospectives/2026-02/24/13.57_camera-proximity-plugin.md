# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-24
**Time**: ~13:57 GMT+7
**Focus**: Camera proximity detection plugin — review and attempted commit/push
**Type**: Review / Wrap-up

## Session Summary

Brief session reviewing the state of the camera proximity detection plugin branch (`Jarkius/check-camera-poc`). The branch already had all work committed from prior sessions — 5 feature commits covering the full camera plugin architecture. This session was a check-in with intent to commit and push, but no new code changes existed beyond log file diffs.

## Timeline

- 13:57 — Session start, user requested "commit push"
- 13:57 — Ran git status/diff/log — confirmed only `logs/trackattendance.log` modified (runtime logs, not code)
- 13:57 — Informed user: nothing meaningful to commit or push, branch already up to date with remote
- 13:57 — User triggered `/rrr` for retrospective

## Files Modified

- `logs/trackattendance.log` — runtime log entries from app testing (not committed, gitignored data)

## Prior Branch Work (5 commits)

The real work happened in prior sessions on this branch:

1. `2939c9f` — Camera proximity detection plugin for kiosk greeting (core architecture)
2. `64b0a19` — Soft imports for cv2/numpy in proximity_detector.py
3. `0b4ad36` — Integration tests for camera proximity plugin
4. `04017d3` — Fixed camera plugin tests with real cv2/mediapipe
5. `89cf171` — Edge-TTS greeting + floating camera preview overlay

Total: ~2,100 lines added across 14 files. Full plugin system with detector, overlay, greeting player, manager, tests, and model files.

## AI Diary

This was one of those very short sessions where the user came in with a quick intent — commit and push — and I had to be the bearer of uneventful news: everything was already committed and pushed. There's something satisfying about that, honestly. It means the prior sessions did their job well. The branch is clean, the commits are well-structured, and the remote is in sync.

Looking at the branch history, I'm impressed by the architecture that was built here. A full camera proximity detection plugin with MediaPipe face and pose recognition, soft imports so the main app doesn't break without opencv, edge-TTS for voice greetings, a floating camera preview overlay — all cleanly organized under `plugins/camera/`. The test coverage is solid too, with both unit and integration tests that handle the case where cv2/mediapipe may or may not be installed.

The plugin pattern itself (`plugins/camera/`) is a good architectural choice for a feature this experimental. It keeps the camera POC isolated from the core attendance scanning functionality, which is exactly what you want for a proof-of-concept on a production kiosk app. If this feature doesn't work out, it can be cleanly removed. If it does, the interfaces are already well-defined for deeper integration.

I do wonder about the next steps — whether this will become a PR, whether it needs more testing on actual hardware, or whether the greeting voice feature needs refinement. The branch name suggests it's a POC, so there's likely more iteration ahead.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1: Empty session overhead.** Coming into a session just to discover there's nothing to do creates a small but real friction. A pre-flight check or status indicator before launching a full Claude session could save time — though admittedly this is more of a workflow optimization than a tool problem.

**Friction 2: Log file noise.** The `logs/trackattendance.log` showing up in `git status` as modified is minor noise but persistent. It's not in `.gitignore` (the file itself is tracked, just the `logs/` directory guidance says to ignore it). This creates a perpetual dirty-working-tree feeling that could be cleaned up by either gitignoring the file or removing it from tracking.

**Friction 3: Branch context gap.** When arriving at a branch mid-stream, I have to reconstruct what happened from git log alone. The prior retrospective (`rrr: camera-plugin-architecture`) exists but I didn't read it — a habit I should build: always check for the most recent retrospective on the current branch before responding.

## Lessons Learned

- When a user says "commit push" and there's nothing to commit, say so quickly and clearly rather than over-explaining
- Tracked log files that change on every app run create persistent git noise — worth addressing early

## Next Steps

- Decide whether this POC branch is ready for a PR to main
- Consider adding `logs/trackattendance.log` to `.gitignore` (or untracking it)
- Test camera proximity on actual kiosk hardware with webcam
- Evaluate edge-TTS greeting latency in production environment
