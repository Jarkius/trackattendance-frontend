# Real Hardware Testing Reveals Bugs Code Review Can't: When building hardware-int

Real Hardware Testing Reveals Bugs Code Review Can't: When building hardware-interactive features (cameras, sensors, scanners), deploy to actual hardware ASAP and let real users interact. Queue confusion, false positives from shadows, audio overlap, and low-confidence ML detections are all bugs that only surface with real hardware + real environment + real people. Anti-pattern: spending weeks perfecting code in isolation before any hardware testing — you'll fix the wrong problems.
